# curvenote-dev

The goal of [curvenote.dev](curvenote.dev) is to provide open source tools to promote and enable interactive scientific writing, reactive documents and explorable explanations.
These tools are used and supported by [curvenote.com](curvenote.com), which is an interactive scientific writing platform that integrates to Jupyter.
